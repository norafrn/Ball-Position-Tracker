# Ball Position
Program models the basic elements of a soccer-like game, where a player can kick a ball within the boundaries of a field.
## Project Description
The program takes in 2 values indicating the kick distance and angle. It operates by first ensuring that the ball stays within the field after being kicked and then tells the user the position of the updated position of the kicked ball.
