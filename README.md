# Ball Position Tracker
Program models the elements of a soccer-like game, where a player can kick a ball within the boundaries of a field.
## Project Description
Program takes in 2 values indicating the kick distance and angle. It operates by first ensuring that the ball stays within the field after being kicked and outputting the updated position of the kicked ball within the field.
